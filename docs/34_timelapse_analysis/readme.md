# Timelapse analysis

In this chapter we will analyse timelapse data. We start by processing data frame-by-frame and extracting features.

## Installation of requirements

In this chapter, we are using [btrack](https://github.com/quantumjot/btrack#installation) which can be installed using mamba/conda:

```
mamba install btrack -c conda-forge
```
